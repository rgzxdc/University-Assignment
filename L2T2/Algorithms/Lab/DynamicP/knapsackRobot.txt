
Every year, there are several natural disasters that happen 
in Bangladesh. One of them occurs by fire. Fire damages our 
valuable products.
That's why the fire service department decided that they will 
invent a robot to save the most valuable product from fire.
N.B: All products are unbreakable. Either you can take the 
product or avoid it from taking.

Now they want your help to design the robot to make it happen. 
Make a program for the robot.

The first line of input will take two integers N and W.
Consider, N is the total number of products available in a 
particular room from where the products need to be taken away.
W is the total weight carrying capability of the robot.
Second-line take N space-separated integers which indicate 
the Weight of the N products.
The third line will take N space-separated integers which 
indicate the value of the N products.

Now, display the maximum value that could be saved from 
that particular room by the robot.
